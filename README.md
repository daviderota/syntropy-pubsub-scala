# Syntropy PubSub Scala

Welcome to the documentation for the Scala SDK for the Data Layer by Syntropy! This SDK allows seamless integration with our Data Layer solution, enabling you to leverage real-time data streams in your Scala applications. With the Scala SDK, you can unlock the power of the Data Layer and harness real-time insights for your data-driven projects.

[syntropy-pubsub-scala](https://github.com/daviderota/syntropy-pubsub-scala) is a Scala example illustrating the use of the Syntropy Data Layer project, which facilitates subscription to existing data streams or publishing new ones. This example employs the NATS messaging system and offers a simpler starting point for integrating Scala applications with the Syntropy Data Layer platform.

# Installation

No installation required. Download the repository and use NatsProvider core class as you like


# Getting Started

Before you begin using the Scala SDK, make sure you have the necessary credentials and access tokens from the Syntropy [Developer Portal](https://developer-portal.syntropynet.com/) platform. These credentials (Access Token) will allow you to connect to the Data Layer and subscribe to or publish data streams.

## Examples

For detailed usage example, please refer to the [examples directory]([https://github.com/daviderota/syntropy-pubsub-scala/subscribe_with_seed.kt](https://github.com/daviderota/syntropy-pubsub-scala/blob/main/src/main/Scala/subscribe_by_seed.kt)) in the repository. 
These examples explain how you can subscribe messages by NATS connection and demonstrate how to utilize the SDK's features effectively.
Another example is [examples directory]([https://github.com/daviderota/syntropy-pubsub-scala/subscribe_with_seed.kt](https://github.com/daviderota/syntropy-pubsub-scala/blob/main/src/main/Scala/publish.kt))

The preferred authentication method is using an access token from the [developer portal](https://developer-portal.syntropynet.com/).
